# Coding-Challenge-6
This coding challenge incorporates a new skill we were taught this week, configuring an HTML Canvas and using Javascript to implement a animation of a bouncing ball. This was 
a challenging assigment and really taught me alot this week and added onto my previous HTML knowledge. After making the HTML Canvas, we implement a ball constructor , a draw function, an update method for collision detection, and implementing the animation using setInterval.
